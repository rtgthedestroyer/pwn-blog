#The art of software exploitation - my review

As a computer science student i always try different areas to see what sticks to me and makes me passionate
about it, this book is how it all started for me, it may be dated but to me it felt like a "zero to hero",
in the world of binary exploitation and vulnerabilty research, it covers the basics, the theory, like nothing
other i saw online, although it may be a bit dry, but a little bit of persistence goes a long way,
anyways, lets start with what you actually learn.

## Prequisites
having the following skills  will help you power through this book with little to no interrupts:
1. a grasp of any assembly language (arm/mips/x86)
2. basic proficency in C 
3. linux cli basics


## What you learn
1. Spotting and mitigating vulnerabillities in C programs
2. using a debugger such as GDB
3. exploiting aged but core vulnerabilites like buffer overflows
4. code injection and shellcoding
5. basic networking and cryptography

##final verdict
Since its a very old book i recommend supplementing it with more modern resources such as LiveOverflow's series on binexp
and solving CTFs related to pwn and reversing (pwnable.kr, pwncollege .. ).

hope you enjoyed this review, until my next book.
